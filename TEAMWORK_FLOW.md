# 🛠️ RISC-Duo Team Workflow Guide

This guide will help you collaborate on the **RISC-V processor project** using Git, **without any hooks or setup scripts**. Everything is **manual and beginner-friendly**.

---

## 📦 0. Naming Convention for Files

We follow a naming rule to keep the project organized:

Files that start with a capital letter (e.g., `Datapath.sv`, `Core.sv`) are top-level modules. These modules typically instantiate smaller submodules inside them.

✅ `Datapath.sv` → contains instances of `alu.sv`, `reg_file.sv`, `mux.sv`, etc.
✅ `Controller.sv` → wraps `main_decoder.sv` and `alu_control.sv`
✅ `Core.sv` → integrates `Datapath.sv` and `Controller.sv`

🔽 Submodules use lowercase names (e.g., `alu.sv`, `mux.sv`, `reg_file.sv`) and are focused on one function only.

---

## 📦 1. Clone the Repository (First Time Only)

Open Git Bash or VS Code terminal and run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AshrafByte/RISC-Duo.git
cd RISC-Duo
```

---

## 🌿 2. Always Work From the `develop` Branch (When Needed)

Before starting new work, you **may** want to bring in updates from the `develop` branch.

### ❗ When to Use This Step:

* ✅ Do this **only if your branch does NOT contain the files or updates you need** from `develop`
* ❌ Skip this step and go to [step 3](#-3-create-a-feature-branch) **if your branch already has everything you need** to avoid conflicts

### Option A: You need everything from `develop`

```bash
git checkout develop
git pull
git checkout feature/your-branch-name
git merge develop
```

⚠️ This brings in **everything** from `develop` — be careful, this can cause merge conflicts.

### Option B: You only need a **specific file or folder**

```bash
# From your feature branch
git checkout feature/your-branch-name

# Bring a file (e.g., Top.sv) from develop
git checkout develop -- single_cycle/Core/Top.sv

# Or bring a whole folder (e.g., Utils)
git checkout develop -- single_cycle/Utils

# Then commit
git add .
git commit -m "chore: bring Top.sv from develop"
```

> 🚨 This avoids unnecessary merges and lets you work only with what your feature needs.

## 🏷️ 3. Create a Feature Branch

Each teammate should use **only one feature branch** depending on their task.

| Task             | Use This Branch      |
| ---------------- | -------------------- |
| DataPath Modules | `feature/datapath`   |
| Control Logic    | `feature/controller` |
| Memories         | `feature/memories`   |
| Core Integration | `feature/core`       |

To create your feature branch:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-branch-name
```

Or switch to it if it already exists:

```bash
git checkout feature/your-branch-name
git pull
```

Example:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/datapath
```

---

## 📄 4. Create New `.sv` Files Manually

You can create files via terminal or your editor:

```bash
touch single_cycle/DataPath/alu.sv
```

Or just right-click and create a file in VS Code.

---

## 📌 5. Add Required Header Lines in Every `.sv` File

At the top of **every new SystemVerilog file**, you **must** manually add:

```systemverilog
`default_nettype none
import types_pkg::*;
```

These lines are **not added automatically** anymore — they are required for correctness.

---

## 💾 6. Stage and Commit Your Changes

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add ALU module"
```

---

## ⬆️ 7. Push Your Feature Branch to GitHub

```bash
git push -u origin feature/your-branch-name
```

Example:

```bash
git push -u origin feature/datapath
```

---

## 🔁 8. Create a Pull Request (PR)

Go to your repo on GitHub. You'll see a button:

> **"Compare & pull request"**

Do this:

* Base branch → `develop`
* Title → Short description like: `feat: Add ALU module`
* Description → Mention what you worked on
* Click **Create pull request**

---

## 🔄 9. Sync Your Branch (Avoid Conflicts By Staying Updated)

If your branch needs updates from `develop`, refer to [step 2](#-2-always-work-from-the-develop-branch-when-needed).

If you only need specific files:

```bash
# Bring a file (e.g., Top.sv) from develop
git checkout develop -- single_cycle/Core/Top.sv

# Or bring a whole folder (e.g., Utils)
git checkout develop -- single_cycle/Utils

git add .
git commit -m "chore: bring files from develop"
```

---

🧹 10. Clean Up After Merge (When Feature Is Fully Complete)
Once your pull request (PR) has been merged into develop and you’ve fully finished working on that feature, you can safely delete your local branch:

```bash
git branch -d feature/your-branch-name
```

❗ Only delete your branch after the PR is merged and you're completely done with that feature.

## ✅ Final Summary

| Action                  | Command or Tool                             |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Clone repo              | `git clone ...`                             |
| Switch to develop       | `git checkout develop`                      |
| Create a feature branch | `git checkout -b feature/xyz`               |
| Add `.sv` file manually | VS Code or `touch`                          |
| Insert required header  | Add 2 lines manually in each file           |
| Commit & push           | `git add . && git commit && git push`       |
| Create Pull Request     | On GitHub GUI                               |
| Keep branch updated     | `git merge develop` or bring specific files |

**💡 Pro Tips:**

* Always pull the latest changes before starting work
* Write clear commit messages using conventional commit format
* Test your code before creating a pull request
* Keep your feature branches focused on a single task
* Communicate with your team about any major changes

---

**🚨 Important Reminders:**

* Never work directly on the `main` or `develop` branch
* Always add the required header lines to `.sv` files
* Regularly sync your branch to avoid merge conflicts
* Delete merged branches to keep your workspace clean
