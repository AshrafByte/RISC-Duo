# 🛠️ RISC-Duo Team Workflow Guide

This guide will help you collaborate on the **RISC-V processor project** using Git, **without any hooks or setup scripts**. Everything is **manual and beginner-friendly**.

---

## 📦 1. Clone the Repository (First Time Only)

Open Git Bash or VS Code terminal and run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AshrafByte/RISC-Duo.git
cd RISC-Duo
```

---

🌿 2. Always Work From the develop Branch (When Needed)

Before starting any new work, you usually update your feature branch with the latest changes from develop:

```bash
git checkout develop
git pull
```

🔹 Only do this if your feature branch depends on new changes or files added in develop.If your feature branch already has everything you need, you can skip this step to avoid unnecessary conflicts.

## 🏷️ 3. Create a Feature Branch

Each teammate should use **only one feature branch** depending on their task.

| Task             | Use This Branch      |
| ---------------- | -------------------- |
| DataPath Modules | `feature-Datapath`   |
| Control Logic    | `feature-Controller` |
| Memories         | `feature-Memories`   |
| Core Integration | `feature-Core`       |

To create your feature branch:

```bash
git checkout -b feature-YourBranchName
```

Or switch to it if it already exists:

```bash
git checkout feature-YourBranchName
git pull
```

Example:

```bash
git checkout -b feature-Datapath
```

---

## 📄 4. Create New `.sv` Files Manually

You can create files via terminal or your editor:

```bash
touch single_cycle/DataPath/alu.sv
```

Or just right-click and create a file in VS Code.

---

## 📌 5. Add Required Header Lines in Every `.sv` File

At the top of **every new SystemVerilog file**, you **must** manually add:

```systemverilog
`default_nettype none
import types_pkg::*;
```

These lines are **not added automatically** anymore — they are required for correctness.

---

## 💾 6. Stage and Commit Your Changes

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add ALU module"
```

---

## ⬆️ 7. Push Your Feature Branch to GitHub

```bash
git push -u origin feature-YourBranchName
```

Example:

```bash
git push -u origin feature-Datapath
```

---

## 🔁 8. Create a Pull Request (PR)

Go to your repo on GitHub. You'll see a button:

> **"Compare & pull request"**

Do this:
* Base branch → `develop`
* Title → Short description like: `feat: Add ALU module`
* Description → Mention what you worked on
* Click **Create pull request**

---

## 🔄 9. Sync Your Branch (Avoid Conflicts)

Do this **every few days**:

```bash
git checkout develop
git pull
git checkout feature-YourBranchName
git merge develop
```

---

## 🧹 10. Clean Up After Merge

Once your PR is merged, you can delete your local branch:

```bash
git branch -d feature-YourBranchName
```

---

**💡 Pro Tips:**
- Always pull the latest changes before starting work
- Write clear commit messages using conventional commits format
- Test your code before creating a pull request
- Keep your feature branches focused on a single task
- Communicate with your team about any major changes

**🚨 Important Reminders:**
- Never work directly on the `main` or `develop` branch
- Always add the required header lines to `.sv` files
- Regularly sync your branch to avoid merge conflicts
